## About
This permits the use of Google Play Music with All Access subscription with any music player able to stream MP3 files and M3U playlists (MPD, VLC, ...). 

Google has released a nice service and now it is even more interesting with the All Access service: the Google-way to listen your collection and the stations is by using Android devices or any your web browser. If you want to use your TVs or HiFi systems, the main tool is Chromecast key. I can't buy one (at the moment it not available in my country) and I already use my HiFi system with MPD and I would like to continue to use it.

My project is based on the great [Unofficial Google Play Music API][1] of Simon Weber: it permits to create URLs to stream the tracks as regular MP3 but they expire in 1 minute! This proxy generates persistent URLs that never expire.
